# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

Include your User Story you analyzed for your project here. Your User Story should have the following format: 

> As an mukbanger, <br> 
> I want to see what foods are trending, <br> 
> so that I can make content and get famous. 

## Dataset 

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type. 

Example: 

Dataset: Made our own because we couldn't find any online 
- **Names** (String) - name of the fast food restaurant 
- **Locations** (int) - number of locations in California 
- **Revenues** (String) - 2023 revenue

## Description 

Our user story is, “As a mukbanger, I want to see what foods are trending, so that I can make content and get famous”.This project provides users with the name, number of locations in California, and 2023 revenue for each fast restaurant. With more locations and higher 2023 revenues, the users can infer a higher popularity, which can be used to film more viral mukbangs. With various methods, variables, parameters, and data sets, the 1D arrays are allowed to be printed out in the DataRunner class.
